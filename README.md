### A custom bot for Cãomunista Gaming Talk discord server.
Dogito is a custom bot made for a discord server that my friends created. The goal was to develop a versatile Discord bot that could be configured to perform a variety of tasks based on our specific requirements. It was built for <strong>PERSONAL</strong> use only, so it is not available to be added to other servers, but feel free to use it as a base to build your own Discord bot. 



## 🐾 Current and Next Steps

The project is still under development and the next updates will focus on the following tasks:

- [x] Give roles according to the reaction emote;
